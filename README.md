# You-Got-This React Project

You-Got-This is a goal tracker react application which uses the Redux and redux-thunk middleware. 
The app allows users to create goals with a description and a deadline tracker that shows how many days are left untill the deadline. 
Each goal has an option of creating steps with multiple date-time events that a user can add to their calender.
Once a user completes a step or an event, they can check them off and/or delete them.
